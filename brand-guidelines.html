    <p class="paragraph">Jessica Hische was born in 1994 brought up in Charleston, South California. Her parents weren't artistic and were seemingly letting their child give her idea of an impractical career choice a go. She attended the Tyler School of Art, Temple University in Philadelphia and has a BFA in Graphic and Interactive Design. She went to Tyler because it was a good school and they encouraged experimentation and image making for their own personal projects unlike other traditional programs. Jessica’s university portfolio consisted mostly of her own unique lettering experimentation and this ultimately set her apart from her class.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">2009 kick started Jessica’s career as the freelance type designer, letterer and illustrator she is still known for today. Jessica Hische reflects a girl who is hard working and was determined to succeed, filling her life with endless freelance jobs which she stated “took over her life.” With great bravery she stripped back and started working on her own project which really established her career and gained her the title of  ‘The Drop Caps Girl’</p>
    <p>Open Sans. Size 15. Ultra Light.</p>
